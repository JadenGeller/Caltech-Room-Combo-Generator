Caltech-Room-Combo-Generator
============================

Generates combos that are compatible with Caltech locks

Rules:
In total, can only use each button once.
At each step, can press any number of buttons.

Note 1: For a 5 button lock, there is a maximum of just 1082 combos.
Note 2: The empty combo '' is actually a valid combo. Likewise, pressing all 5 buttons at once is also valid.

Fun fact: The locks actually allow for half-presses, but they are somewhat risky!
